function [adj]=cylindrical_shear_adj(BP_sizes,dst,shear_fe,decomp,level)
% The function computes the cylindrical shearlet adjoint of the data set
%  generated from setup_cylindrical_decomp and cylindrical_shear.
%  Input:    BP_sizes - sizes of the pyramid decomposition arrays
%            dst - cylindrical shearlet transform coefficients
%            shear_fe - cylindrical shearing filters
%            decomp - record of directions of decomposition 
%  Output:   adj - 3D array representing the adjoint
